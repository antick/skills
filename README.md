# Antick Skills

41 skills for AI coding agents: building, debugging, code review and pull
requests, refactoring, dependency upgrades, security, database and performance
audits, tests and CI, releases, documentation, workstation upkeep, and clear writing.

[Website](https://skills.potion.sh) · [Install](#install) · [All skills](SKILLS.md)

## Install

```sh
npx skills@latest add antick/skills --global
```

A menu opens. Pick the skills you want and the agents to install them in.
Restart your agents afterwards.

## Update

```sh
npx skills@latest update --global
```

`update` refreshes only the skills you already installed, and only from the
`main` branch on GitHub. Changes that are still on another branch or in an open
pull request are not picked up. It also never installs skills that were added to
the repository after your install. To get new skills, run the install command
again and pick them in the menu:

```sh
npx skills@latest add antick/skills --global
```

To try a branch before it is merged, install from it with
`npx skills@latest add antick/skills#<branch> --global`. Skills installed that
way keep following that branch on `update`, so reinstall from `antick/skills`
once it is merged.

Or ask your agent with `$update-skills`. It runs the update, lists skills added
or removed upstream and skills that follow a branch, and asks before it installs
or removes anything.

## Remove

```sh
npx skills@latest remove --global
```

A menu opens. Pick the skills to remove. Use this to clear out skills that were
renamed: `repo-disk-cleanup` (now `reclaim-dev-space`), `save-window-layout` (now
`save-omarchy-window-layout`), `update-ai-tools` or `manage-ai-tools` (now
`ai-harness-setup`), and `upgrade-dependencies` (now `dependency-upgrade-minor`
and `dependency-upgrade-major`).

These commands use the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) CLI. It sends anonymous usage
data; set `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` to turn that off. Avoid its `--all` flag
with `--global`: it targets every agent the CLI knows, and some of them can't
install globally, so you get dozens of errors.

[SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md) maps common tasks to the skill and guide that covers them.
Each skill's `SKILL.md` is the source of truth for what it does.

A few behave differently from the rest:

- **`ai-harness-setup`, `save-omarchy-window-layout`, and `update-skills`** run
  only when you call them by name. `ai-harness-setup` only updates by default; say
  "also install missing tools" to install. Its
  [tool list](skills/ai-harness-setup/references/tools.md) covers 19 tools and
  runtimes. `save-omarchy-window-layout` needs an existing Omarchy/Hyprland setup.
  `update-skills` asks before it installs or removes any skill.
- **`reclaim-dev-space`** shows its findings in chat first and deletes nothing
  until you pick items from that report.
- **`interview`** saves to memory only what you approve, and never to the repository.
- **`code-build`** commits in meaningful steps, pushes a branch, and opens a draft
  PR unless you ask for local-only work. **`submit-review`**, **`sync-branch`**, and
  **`build-review-loop`** post to GitHub or push branches as part of their job.
- **`code-debug`** never changes code, and asks before any browser action that
  changes data.

## Use a skill

Call it by name. The syntax depends on your agent:

| Agent | Syntax |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | `$code-review` |
| Claude Code, OpenCode | `/code-review` |
| Pi | `/skill:code-review` (or `/code-review` with the Pi extension) |

Add your request after the name:

```text
$code-review Review my uncommitted changes.
$code-build Add search to this Astro site.
$reclaim-dev-space Find what's eating my disk.
$code-debug Find out why login fails after a password reset.
$build-review-loop Build issues 12 and 14, self-review each PR, and fix until clean.
$antick
$antick free up disk space taken by worktrees and node_modules
```

Not sure which skill to use? Run `antick` with your task.

A skill only gives your agent instructions. The agent's own permissions still
decide what it can do. Audits and reviews report by default; ask for changes
when you want them.

### Plugins and adapters

Installing copies skill folders only. These are set up separately:

- **Claude Code and Codex:** plugin manifests in `.claude-plugin/` and
  `.codex-plugin/`, including marketplace files. They're in the Git repo, not the
  npm package.
- **OpenCode:** [.opencode/plugins/skills.mjs](.opencode/plugins/skills.mjs) adds
  the skills folder and a slash command per skill. See [opencode.json](opencode.json).
- **Pi:** [pi-extension/index.js](pi-extension/index.js) adds `/code-review`-style
  commands that forward to `/skill:code-review`. The `pi` field in `package.json`
  loads it.

## Contribute

Edit `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; keep supporting guides next to it. When you add,
rename, or remove a skill, update `SKILLS.md`, `packs.json`, the plugin manifests,
`pi-extension/commands.json`, `skills/antick/references/catalogue.md`, and the
website catalogue (`website/src/lib/catalog.ts` or `engineering-catalog.ts`, plus
`skill-icons.ts`). The tests fail if any of them disagree. The `new-skill` skill
walks through all of this.

```sh
npm test
node --test website/tests/*.test.mjs
npm pack --dry-run
```

With the website's dependencies installed, `npm run check --prefix website` also
catches a missing icon.

To try your local changes, install from the checkout with `node scripts/install.mjs`.
It opens the same kind of menu; `--help` lists its options.

The website lives in `website/`; see [website/README.md](website/README.md).
